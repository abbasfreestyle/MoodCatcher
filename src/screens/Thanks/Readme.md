## Add Mood Mutation

The whole purpose of graphQL is for the user to make 1 API request and let the server deal with multiple executions. Being new to graphQL, i couldn't achieve the mutation that i would have desired. Instead of looping through a list of feelings and adding these items 1 at a time. The correct solution would be to have 1 mutation to let the lambda function take care of adding multiple feeling items that are related to the mood.
